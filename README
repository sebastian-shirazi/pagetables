### Simulation of a multi-level Page Table

# How to Customize config.h
In `config.h`, there are two constants defined: `LEVELS` and `POBITS`. `LEVELS` represents the number of levels of this multi-level page table, and changing the number of levels will result in the virtual memory address spacing being split by the specified number of levels. `POBITS` on the other hand defines how many offset bits each address contains. In this configuration, there are 12 offset bits deinfed in `config.h`, and these bits are just used in order to locate specific data that maps to each offset on a given page.

# Limitations
Although this implementation works for our testing purposes, it may not be fully complete. There are edge cases that result in page faults that might not pass for this page table, as well as the pagetable implementation itself not adhering to the LRU priniciple for evicting pages. For future improvements, I could implement a form of "caching" within my program to track the state of the data stored in the sets, and see which data is accesses more frequently when choosing which address to evict from the table.

# Time and Space Complexity
For time complexity the lookup in this pagetable is dependent on the number of levels contained in the table. This is because if the offset is not defined on a level, we will need to traverse the levels of the pagetable until a hit is present at a given address. So we can say the time this table takes to lookup an address is defined by O(L), where L is `LEVELS`. For space complexity, the multi-level page table is a `LEVELS` level page table, with say `n` entries per level. This would be defined as O(n * L) for spacial complexity.

# Support for De-Allocation
After reviewing the allocate and translate function, it is possible to have a page de-allocation function, defined in `mlpt.h` as `int page_deallocate(size_t va);`. This function would take a virtual address, and de-allocates the page corresponding to that address and will need help from a helper function to free the memory. This works as the allocation of a page is not affected by a de-allocation, and the translation of a virtual address to a physical address also is not affected by a deallocation of a page. The de-allocation function would return -1 if unsuccessful, and 0 if successful.
